Conversion data loss explanation:

This test case covers docbook format feature where <title> levels are determined
from the depth of nesting inside <section> elements. That is a native docbook
behaviour kept for compatibility reasons. In conversion back from XHTML edit format
to docbook explicit level attributes will be generated, which are not present in
the corresponding docbook fixture.

Since HTML supports headings up to level 6 only, <title> with implicit level greater
than 6 would be converted back to docbook as explicit level 6.

No special test case for conversion to docbook is needed as this is already
covered by:
